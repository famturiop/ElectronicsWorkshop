Simple webapi app that utilizes an Onion architecture.

It uses EntityFramework, FluentValidation, AutoMapper, IdentityServer, Swagger, OpenApi.

Comments/TO DO:
- Even if you agreed upon using REST api, HttpStatusCodes should not be in the Application layer; UI logic should be put in controllers
- Mappings should be done in separate services
